## TEAM PLAYSTYLE

|                 | Passing      | Off Ball Movement | Defensive Line | Pressing        |
|:---------:      |:-------:     |:-----------------:|:--------------:|:--------:       |
|Possesion        |Shortest      |Come short         |Highest         |Semi-aggressive  |
|Quick counter    |Mixed         |Most runs          |High            |Aggressive, high |
|Long ball counter|Direct        |Run from deep      |Deepest         |Sprint to regroup|
|Out wide         |Mix, use wings|Wide, overload box |Mid-block       |Regroup          |
|Long ball        |Direct        |Defence sits       |Deep            |Regroup          |

* **POSSESION**: aims to strangle the opponents by defending with the ball. A high line and high press is susceptible to through balls. It has the least runs forward as players come to the ball, so need to use LB+pass for a vertical 1-2, or RB+pass for a horizontal 1-2. I think Classic Number 10's do the best in this playstyle.
* **QUICK COUNTER**: has a high line too, and has the most aggressive team press. It feels fluid as players flood forward to make themselves available for a pass, but this then leaves you susceptible to the counter attack.
* **LONG BALL COUNTER**: is aimed at those who will have a low defensive line, so don't engage pressing until the opposition are in your half or you'll create a lot of space between FWDS and MIDS, and MIDS and DEF. You'll concede more deflections and give up possession and invite players onto you. When you gain the ball, you'll play direct to take advantage of your team bursting forward.
* **OUT WIDE**: is probably the most balanced of all playstyles defensively and offensively. In possession use the width of the touchline the players will hug. When you get into crossing positions, your MIDS and opposite winger will burst into the box to look to get onto crosses.
* **LONG BALL**: has your defence sit very deep with the aim of frustrating your opponent with men behind the ball and looking to play direct to 2-3 attackers and grab a goal. Fewer players support the attack than long ball counter.


### TIPS 
*  In general case:
    * If the playstyle have high defensive line, you should use Offensive Goalkeepers (Neuer, Allisson,...) to sweep up the space in front of them rather than to use Defensive Goalkeepers. In 
        * **GK**: **Offensive goalkeepers** *(Neuer, Onana, Allisson, ...)*
    * For the centre back, usually a combine of a Build Up (Beckenbauer, Van Dijk, De Light,...) with an Destroyer (Thiago Silva, Koulibaly,...) or you can use double Build Up.
        * **CB**: **Build up** *(Beckenbauer, Van Dijk, De Light,...)*/ **Destroyer** *(Thiago Silva, Koulibaly,...)*
    * Combine 1 attacking right-back/left-back with 1 defensive left-back/right-back to have a back up person if you take a counter.
        * **RB/LB**: **Attacking full-back** *(Trent, Ben White,...)* / **Defensive full-back** *(Wanbi Saka, Pavard,...)*
    * For the middlefiled, a cmf like Orchestrator or Creative playmaker (great ball control and good passing) combine with some Box-to-box or Hole Player for diverse attacking while dmf must have Anchorman or Destroyer for good defending and holding their position(If your CB have one Destroyer, you should use Anchorman).
        * **CMF**: **Orchestrator** *(Modric, Xhaka,...)* / **Creative plamaker** *(Pedri, De Bruyne,...)* / **Hole player** *(Bellingham, Fekir,...)* / **Box-to-Box** *(De Paul, Rice,...)* 
        * **DMF**: **Anchorman** *(Rodri, Casemiro,...)* / **Destroyer** *(Palhinha, Veira,...)*
    * In the front line, with wingers you can use both Prolific Winger and Roaming Flank, it depends on whether if you like speed or dribbling or passing. For striker, i recommend Goal Poacher combine with Hole Player if you use CF with SS or CF with wingers is fine.
        * **FW**: **Goal Pocher** *(Mbappe, Haaland)* / **Prolific Winger** *(Saka,Dembele)* / **Roaming Flank** *(Salah, Diaby)*

* Player progression: I recommend you to level up fully for the player before adjust any points because it helps you achieve better rating than adjust little points.

* Some note about player style:
- In my experience, the hardest style to play is **Target man** and usually i see no one play this style :))). I think the most reasons that people hate this style becasue it's really hard to protect the ball, and most users tend to play one touch more often than shielding and dribbling.
- And here are some style you should'nt try if you still not familiar to the gameplay: **Deep-lying forward**, **Classic No 10**, **Extra Frontman**, **Dummy Runner**, **Fox in the Box**.
- Combo you can try :))):
    * Double Buid Up (Solid defend)
    * Box-to-box and Hole player (Easy to play)
    * Cross Specialist/Prolific winger with **Pinpoint Crossing** and a Goal Poacher with **Header** and **Aerial superiority**


### SKILLS
- Basic skills:
    * Doubletap the joystick will stop the ball 
    * Flick the joystick while pressing dash will push the ball further
    * Fake shot is performed when you press shoot then flick the joystick
- To perform a skill, you need to make a combination of the joystick and the dash button. And there are 2 things you need to notice: The player's skills and the direction of the player when you wanna perform a skill. For example, player without **Double touch** is unable to perform this skill.
- Here is you do it: Press dash then flick your joystick to the direction you want your player to perform the skill. And normally this should be like this:

|DIRECTION | SKILL APPLIED |
|:---------:|:-------------:|
|Front      | Double touch/ Special double touch, Scotch move, some skill i dont know the name :)))|
|Left/ Right| Marseille turn, Chop turn|
|Back       | Giật bóng về sau |

- And to perform skill effectively, it's all about timing. When your timing is perfect, you are unstoppable:

**This one is very basic, i use double touch to open more space to shoot**

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ababad88-2039-439c-9e6f-38418a5dc54f

**This one is similar to the above but this time chop turn is applied**

**This one is harder than it looks, and let me explain why:**

    * Tiếng anh em hơi ngoo nên em giải thích tiếng việt trước ạ :'(
    * Đầu tiên là lần chạm đầu của Del, nó chếch sang trái 1 chút để lừa hậu vệ rồi em ngoặt người sang phải quay đầu rồi dash chạy thẳng luôn
    * Cách đá này giống y hệt cách đá của Messi ý ạ, như trong [clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjMofjmzQKU) (phút thứ 2 và thứ 4) này luôn 
    * Và để làm được trò này thì thằng cầu thủ của anh cần có balance 9x, ball control 9x với tight possesion 85+ thì làm mới dễ thành công ạ
    * Xong qua được rồi thì em dash đi để thằng thủ ko tỳ mình rồi cùng lúc cbi dash tiếp vượt qua thằng hậu vệ 
    * Trông khá dễ nhưng chắc vài trận em mới đc 1 trận như này :)))
